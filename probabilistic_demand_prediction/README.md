## Building-level electricity and HVAC demand prediction
Authors: Akash Mahajan, Van-Hai Bui

This GitHub repository contains code for building Bayesian Neural Network and Monte-Carlo LSTM (MC-LSTM)
for implemeting building-level energy demand prediction models for electricity and HVAC.

**Project Structure:**
- `utils`: Contains code for data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, visualization, and neural network.

Note: We have used PyCharm Community Edition to write all program files.
